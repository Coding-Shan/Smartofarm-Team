                        <li>The younger leaves may die in succession and the entire may wilt and die in a course of few
                            days. Soon the petiole and the leaves droop and wilt.</li>
                        <li>In young plants, symptom consists of clearing of veinlet and dropping of petioles. In field,
                            yellowing of the lower leaves first and affected leaflets wilt and die.</li>
                        <li>The symptoms continue in subsequent leaves. At later stage, browning of vascular system
                            occurs. Plants become stunted and die.</li>

                            and crinkling of the leaves. The newly emerging leaves exhibit slight yellow coloration and

                        <li>Older leaves become leathery and brittle. The nodes and internodes are significantly reduced

                        <li>The infected plants look pale and produce more lateral branches giving a bushy appearance.
