    <h1>Nutrient Management in Organic Farming</h1>
    <p>Nutrient management on organic farms should
        economically meet crop nutrient needs and avoid soil
        nutrient depletion, while maintaining or improving soil
        productivity without excessive nutrient losses. Soil nutrient
        availability is dependent on diverse soil chemical, physical, and biological properties, their interactions, and
        their
        interaction with the cropping system. While measurements
        can be made for many soil properties, crop performance
        is the best indicator of soil productivity. Farmers typically
        manage to minimize soil physical and chemical constraints
        to sustainable productivity through practices such as:
        <br> 1. Applying organic materials such as manure, compost,
        and biofertilizers to supply nutrients and maintain soil
        organic matter
        <br> 2. Growing cover crops to cycle soil nutrients and biologically fix atmospheric nitrogen
        <br> 3. Diversifying crop rotations for more efficient recovery
        and physiological use
    </p>
    <h2>Soil and plant tissue analysis</h2>
    <p>Most crop essential soil nutrients are adequately supplied by agricultural soils in Nebraska. Application of
        nitrogen and phosphorus is most common for high crop productivity in Nebraska. Deficiencies of potassium, sulfur
        (with
        sandy soil), iron (with calcareous soil), and zinc can occur
        and require attention in some fields. Yield increases due to
        application of other nutrients are rare in Nebraska. Management to avoid acidic soil conditions (Nebraska
        Extension
        NebGuides G1503 and G1504) and soil aggregation, and to
        avoid compaction (NebGuide G896) are also important for
        ensuring sufficient nutrient availability to crops. <br>
        Soil sampling every four years is advised to test for
        soil organic matter, pH, and availabilities of phosphorus,
        potassium, and zinc, as well as other properties of interest.
        Soil sampling practices and methods, such as grid versus
        management zone sampling, are addressed in NebGuide
        G1740. Soil pH 6 is the desired minimum pH for most organic cropping systems in Nebraska. Iron deficiency is
        commonly associated with calcareous soils with pH > 7.2.
        Alkaline soils on organic farms can be acidified over time
        by applying OMRI-approved mineral sulfur (e.g., sulfate of
        potash) or acidic mulches (e.g., pine needles).
        Applying agricultural lime to raise soil pH is allowed
        in organic production. Beef feedlot manure has a liming effect, typically the equivalent of about 60 pounds of
        agricultural lime per ton of manure dry weight. However,
        most other manures and composts, and biological nitrogen fixation, have a net acidifying effect. Plant and soil
        testing laboratories commonly do recommend nutrient
        application rates, but Nebraska Extension EC155, Nutrient
        Management for Agronomic Crops in Nebraska is especially
        valuable for interpretation of soil test results and determination of nutrient and lime application rates. <br>
        Critical levels for soil nutrient availability represent
        thresholds above which no yield increase is expected due to
        application of the nutrient, although application of organic
        materials may have other positive effects on the crop. See
        Table 1 for a sample of critical soil test values for several
        essential plant nutrients for common field crops in Nebraska. These values can be used as a starting point for
        making
        annual decisions about nutrient sources and application
        rates; however, developing a long-term nutrient management plan and proactive (instead of reactive) management
        of soil fertility is advised for organic farms. </p>
    <h2>Nutrient Source :-</h2>
    <h3>-: MANURE :-</h3>
    <p>Manure application is often valuable to organic production. However, applying manure to meet all of the crop
        nitrogen demand can lead to excessive soil phosphorus
        because crops remove more nitrogen than phosphorus.
        The excessive soil phosphorus is not likely to be harmful to
        crops but contributes to phosphorus loss in runoff and erosion and contamination of water bodies. Therefore,
        manure
        nitrogen needs to be complemented by biological nitrogen
        fixation or other nitrogen sources in organic systems. <br> A nutrient budget can be a useful tool for long-term
        accounting of phosphorus addition via manure (or other
        fertilizer source) and removal via harvested crops (see example in Table 2). This approach to nutrient
        management
        can help to ensure organic farmers do not unsustainably
        mine inherent soil nutrient reserves, and on the other end
        of the extreme, do not build up soil nutrient levels of high
        risk for environmental contamination <br> The National Organic Program restricts the use of manure on crops for
        human consumption. Raw manure must
        be applied more than 120 days before harvest if the edible
        portion of the crop will be in direct contact with soil, and
        90 days before harvest if the edible portion of the crop will
        not be in direct contact with soil. These restrictions do not
        apply for composted manure and for crops not intended for
        human consumption; however, if the farm is Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) certified (https://www.ams.usda
        .gov/services/auditing/gap-ghp), it is important to consult
        with the certification agency for recent guidelines prior to
        any manure applications. <br>Typical nutrient concentration estimates for different
        manure sources are available (Table 3), but actual nutrient
        content varies with the methods of manure storage and
        handling, livestock ration, animal maturity, and weather
        conditions. Thus, manure samples should be analyzed for
        nutrient content before application (NebGuide G1450).
        Manure application equipment should be calibrated to
        ensure the desired rate of nutrient application (NebGuide
        G1335). <br>Manure nitrogen is primarily in organic and ammonium forms. Ammonium-nitrogen is immediately
        available
        to the crop for uptake if it is not lost to volatilization as ammonia. Ammonium-nitrogen availability depends on
        if
        the manure is injected or surface-applied, the time before
        incorporation if surface-applied, temperature, and precipitation or irrigation events (Table 4). Manure organic
        nitrogen must be mineralized to ammonium before it can
        be used by plants. Estimated organic nitrogen availability
        to the first crop following application varies with manure
        type, ranging from 25 percent for solid beef feedlot manure
        to 50 percent for fresh swine manure. Estimated nitrogen
        availability for second, third, and fourth crops after application are 15, 7, and 4 percent, respectively, of
        the total
        organic nitrogen applied. </p>
    <h3>-: COMPOST :-</h3>
    <p>Composting processes organic waste into material 
        of higher nutrient concentration, and reduces the bulk of 
        organic materials through carbohydrate and water loss 
        during decomposition (NebGuide G1315). Compost is often easier to handle than the bulk organic material, and the 
        composting process kills some pathogens and weed seeds. 
        Compost has less odor and fewer microbial pathogens, 
        with less risk of microbial contamination of fresh produce 
        than with raw manure. There are fewer NOP restrictions on 
        the use of compost in edible crops, but composted animal 
        manures must be applied to soil prior to planting to mitigate pathogen risks. For GAPs-certified growers, composts 
        must meet Food Safety Modernization Act standards. <br> Nitrogen mineralization for finished composts with a 
        carbon:nitrogen ratio (C:N) less than 20:1 occurs readily 
        with much of the organic nitrogen released to the first crop 
        following application. Composts with C:N greater than 
        30:1 will result in net immobilization of soil nitrogen with 
        reduced nitrogen availability to the first crop following 
        application. Nearly all of the nitrate and ammonium in the 
        compost will be available to the plants the first season after 
        application, but only 15 percent of the organic nitrogen in the compost may be available during that season if the 
        C:N is high. Organic N availability estimates for years two 
        through four are the same as for manure (15, 7, and 4 percent, respectively). <br> In addition to supplying nitrogen, compost is an 
        important source of other macro- and micronutrients. As 
        with other organic materials, compost application can improve soil organic matter content, cation exchange capacity, 
        soil porosity, aggregate stability, and water-holding capacity, although the magnitude of improvements will depend 
        on current soil organic matter levels (NebGuide G2283). 
        Similarly, soil biological properties, including microbial 
        biomass, microbial enzymatic activity, and nitrification potential are often increased following compost application. 
        Despite the many benefits of compost, raw manure is still 
        popular because of the added cost of composting and the 
        nitrogen volatilization loss that occurs during composting.</p>
    <h2>Other products for nutrient supply</h2>
    <p>For organic production of agronomic crops, manure,
        compost, and nitrogen fixation are the main sources of
        added nutrients. However, other organic products are used
        to enhance nutrient availability for high-value crops (Table
        4) with varying nutrient composition and mineralization
        rates. As with manure and compost, the nutrient mineralization rates of such products are largely driven by the
        C:N. Use of these products for lower value commodities is
        limited due to high purchase and shipping costs. Given the
        low nutritional content of compost, manure, and organic
        products on a mass basis (relative to fertilizer), economic
        feasibility of application decreases as distance from the
        source increases</p>
    <h3>-: BIOFERTILIZERS:-</h3>
    <p>Biofertilizers are products designed to provide enhanced
        nutrient availability and uptake, stimulation of crop growth,
        biological nitrogen fixation, and protection against insect
        pests and disease. Depending on the purpose, biofertilizer
        products can be applied to soil, seeds, or foliar tissue. Evidence to support product claims is often limited or
        mixed.
        Recent research suggests biofertilizers may be most beneficial
        in soils of low to moderate soil organic matter and nutrient
        availability or with foliar application. In contrast, biofertilizer
        applications to soils of >3 percent organic matter rarely result
        in measurable crop or soil benefits. Introduced microorganisms often fail to compete and survive with already
        wellestablished and resilient microbial communities <br>Several common categories of biofertilizers include
        nitrogen-fixers, phosphorus-solubilizers, phosphorusabsorbers, and humic acid. Nitrogen-fixers such as Rhizobium
        (in symbiosis with legumes), Azospirillum, and
        Azotobacter convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia.
        Bacillus and Pseudomonas are examples of microbes found
        in phosphorus-solubilizing biofertilizers that lower the soil
        pH to dissolve soil-bound phosphate for plant availability
        and may be most effective for calcareous soils. Arbuscular
        mycorrhizal fungi take up soil phosphorus, zinc, and copper and transfer these to plant roots, but these are
        typically
        abundant in Nebraska agricultural soils. Humic acid is
        important to plant growth but is already abundant in most
        soils. A soil with 3 percent organic matter may have as
        much as 10–15 tons of humic acid in the surface soil layer;
        thus, adding a few more ounces per acre is unlikely to
        enhance crop growth and yield</p>
