                    <ul>
                        <li>The fungus is an obligate pathogen which can attack all green parts of the vine.</li>
                        <li>Symptoms of this disease are frequently confused with those of powdery mildew. Infected
                            leaves develop pale yellow-green lesions which gradually turn brown. Severely infected
                            leaves often drop prematurely.</li>
                        <li>Infected petioles, tendrils, and shoots often curl, develop a shepherd's crook, and
                            eventually turn brown and die</li>
                        <li>Young berries are highly susceptible to infection and are often covered with white fruiting
                            structures of the fungus. Infected older berries of white cultivars may turn dull
                            gray-green, whereas those of black cultivars turn pinkish red</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Survival and spread</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The fungus overwinters mainly in the fallen leaves which are the source of primary
                            infection. Secondary infection occurs by motile zoospores by splashing rain.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The most serious outbreaks have been found to occur when a wet winter is followed by a wet
                            spring and a warm summer with intermittent rains

                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>To treat a downy mildew outbreak with hydrogen peroxide and baking soda: Day 1 (early in the
                            morning): Combine 3/4 cup of 3% hydrogen peroxide per gallon of water in the tank of a
                            sprayer.
                            Spray infected plants liberally with the solution—making sure to cover all sides of the
                            leaves,
                            stems, and fruit</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Powdery mildew, caused by the fungus Uncinulanecator, can infect all green tissues of
                                the
                                grapevine</li>
                            <li>Tissues are generally susceptible to infection throughout the growing season</li>
                            <li>Diseased leaves appear whitish gray, dusty, or have a powdery white appearance.
                                Petioles,
                                cluster stems, and green shoots often look distorted or stunted. Berries can be infected
                                until their sugar content reaches about 8%.</li>
                            <li>If infected when young, the epidermis of the berry can split and the berries dry up or
                                rot.
                                When older berries are infected, a netlike pattern often develops on the surface of the
                                berry</li>
                        </ul>

                                surface of the vines. When conditions are favorable for growth of the fungus in spring,
                                spores are produced, released, and cause new infections. Secondary spread of the disease
                                can
                                occur if spores are produced in these new infections.

                            Anthracnose, caused by the fungus Elsinoe ampelina, is also known as bird’s-eye rot from its
                            appearance on the fruit</li>
                        <li>The disease appears first as dark red spots on the berry. Later, these spots are circular,
                            sunken, ashy-gray and in late stages these spots are surrounded by a dark margin which gives
                            it
                            the “bird’s-eye rot” appearance. The spots vary in size from 1/4 inch in diameter to about
                            half
                            the fruit.</li>
                        <li>The fungus also attacks shoots, tendrils, petioles, leaf veins, and fruit stems. Numerous
                            spots
                            sometimes occur on the young shoots. These spots may unite and girdle the stem, causing
                            death of
                            the tips. Spots on petioles and leaves cause them to curl or become distorted</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>This fungus can infect all green parts of the vine including leaves, tendrils, new shoots,
                            as well as berries. However, mature leaves and ripe fruit are not susceptible. Infections of
                            leaves first appear as red spots on the upper leaf surface in late spring.</li>
                        <li>These circular spots enlarge and become tan to light brown with distinct, dark borders.
                            Small, pinpoint black fruiting structures of the fungus often develop in the centers of
                            these spots.</li>
                        <li>Most serious damage usually occurs on the berries. On the fruit, infections first appear as
                            whitish spots which enlarge to sunken areas with dark borders. Significant infections
                            usually occur when the grape is pea-size or larger. As infection progresses, the fruit
                            becomes black, wrinkled, mummified, and look like raisins. Infected grapes often
                            shatter,leaving only the stem</li>
