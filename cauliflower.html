                        <li>In the pre-emergence the phase the seedlings are killed just before they reach the soil
                            surface.</li>
                        <li>The young radical and the plumule are killed and there is complete rotting of the seedlings
                        </li>
                        <li>The post-emergence phase is characterized by the infection of the young, juvenile tissues of
                            the collar at the ground level</li>
                        <li>The infected tissues become soft and water soaked. The seedlings topple over or collapse
                        </li>

                        <li>Infection of seedling stems by the damping off fungi results in thin wiry rotted stems that
                            cannot support the seedling. Sterilize all used pots and trays in a solution of 10%
                            household bleach by soaking for 30 minutes. Use new potting mix to fill trays. Don't reuse
                            potting mix and don't use garden soil or compost</li>

                            <li>Clubroot thrives in acidic soil, so raising the pH to at least 7.2 may be one of the
                                most effective means of attaining clubroot control. Ohio State University Extension
                                advises that calcitic lime is the best way to raise the pH, unless your soil is low in
                                magnesium. In this case, dolomitic lime may be more effective</li>

                                keeping leaves dry may reduce disease severity. For sensitive crops such as arugula and
                                rappini, avoid planting in fields having a history of white rust problems; soilborne
                                oospores may result in severe disease</li>
