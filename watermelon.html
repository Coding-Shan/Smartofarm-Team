                        <li>The spots turn necrotic with age. The diseased leaves become yellow and fall down. Diseased
                            plants get stunted and die. Fruits produced may not mature and have a poor taste.</li>
                        <li>Yellow, angular spots restricted by veins resembling mosaic mottling appear on upper surface
                            of leaves</li>

                        <li>The pathogen survives in disease plant debris. Primary spread occurs by means of oospores in
                            soil and sporangia from perennial collateral weed hosts in the vicinity. Secondary spread
                            occurs by wind and rain splashe.</li>

                        <li>Copper fungicide may offer some protection but in large cropping situations mobile
                            fungicides with an active ingredient that attacks the fungi are recommended. Mefanoxam with
                            either mancozeb or chlorothalonil seem to provide the best protection. Sprays should be used
                            every five to seven days.</li>
