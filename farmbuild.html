    <h1>Organic Farm Management</h1>
    <p>As organic management is an integrated approach,manipulation and adoption of one or few steps may not yield
        significant results. For optimization of productivity all the essential components need to be developed in a
        systematic manner.</p>
    <p>These steps includes:</p>
    <p>1. Habit Development</p>
    <p>2. On farm facilities for input production</p>
    <p>3. Croping sequence and combination planning</p>
    <p>4. 3-4 year rotatioion plan </p>
    <p>5. Growing of crops suiting to the region ,soil and climate.</p>
    <div class="container"></div>
    <h2>Development of farm facilities and habitat</h2>
    <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>Reserve 3-5% of farm space for utilities, such as space for
        cattle, vermicompost bed, compost tank, Vermiwash/ compost tea unit etc. 5-7
        trees should be planted only on this space, as all utility infrastructure need
        shade. Irrigation well, water pumping infrastructure etc can also be in this utility
        area. Dig some percolation tanks ( 7 x 3 x 3 mt or of any other size depending upon
        the rainfall and run-off pattern) for rain water conservation (1 pit per ha) at
        appropriate places depending upon slope and water flow. If possible develop a
        farm pond of preferably 20 x 10 mt size. Keep few 200 lit tanks (1 per acre) for
        liquid manure preparation and few containers for botanicals. For a 5 acre farm,
        develop 1-2 vermicompost beds, 1 NADEP tank, 2 biodynamic compost beds, 2-
        3 compost tea/ vermiwash units, 5 liquid manure tanks, five cowpat pits and one
        underground cattle-urine collection tank. Efforts should also be made to produce
        sufficient quantities of BD-500 (cow horn manure) and BD-501 (cow horn silica).
        10-12 horn products are sufficient for 5 acre farm. Use of biodynamic compost
        prepared with the use of BD-502-507 has also been found to be very effective. </p>
    <h3>Habitat and biodiversity</h3>
    <p>- Management of an appropriate habitat for sustenance
        of different life forms is an essential component of organic farming. This can be
        achieved by ensuring crop diversity and by maintaining a wide variety of trees
        and bushes as per climatic suitability. These trees and bushes will not only
        ensure the nutrients from air and deep soil layers to surface layer but also attract
        the birds and predators, friendly insects and also provide the food and shelter.
        More specifically, if we classify areas into wet and dry farms, then on the wet
        farms there should be five to six neem trees, one to two wood apples, one to two
        star fruit, eight to ten guava or sour soap, three to four drumstick, one to two fig
        and 10– 15 bushes of mulberry, star gooseberry, curry leaf etc, and on the dry
        farms there must be at least five to six neem, one to two bael fruit, eight to ten
        ber or custard apple, one to two aonla , one to two drumstick and 10– 15 bushes
        of sasaka , nirgundi (Vitex negundo), Cassia auriculata, C. tora, etc.
        In hilly areas, Alnus nepalensis is considered to be a wonder tree as it fixes good
        amount of nitrogen. It is being promoted in a cropping system mode particularly
        in northeastern India. Bushes of Prunus, oak (Quercus glauca), Pinus species
        along the farm boundary and yarrow (Achillea millifolium), buck wheat
        (Fagopyrum esculentum), lupin (Lupinus sativus), Himalayan stinging nettle
        (Urtica parviflora), marigold, etc., in between the plots invite a lot of predators
        and also attract a large number of pests.
        Fruit orchards also need to maintain adequate diversity with at least 3-5 types of
        fruit plants and few non-fruit trees (as listed above).
        Major and minor plots should be separated by bunds about 1.5 m wide and
        should be planted with Glyricidia, perennial Sesbania (jayanti), Leucaena
        leucocephala, cassia siamea, etc. The internal hedgerow should consist of
        perennial pigeon pea, Crotalaria , seasonal Sesbania, etc. Lops from these trees
        will provide enough quantity of biologically fixed nitrogen.
        In between Glyricidia/Sesbania rows insert few plants of pesticidal value such as
        Adathoda vesica, Vitax nigundo, Calotropis, Datura alba, Ipomea (Besharam)
        etc. Surrounding the farm or garden, there should be hedgerows or a live fence
        of coppiced or pollarded, multipurpose, deep-rooted trees and shrubs and
        medicinal herbs such as Adathoda vasica, Vitex negundo, Jatropha curcas, etc.
        Ecological diversity is an essential component of any successful organic farming
        system.
        Trees on utility space can be allowed to grow fully. Trees and bushes on farm
        bunds should be placed randomly at sufficient distance and pruned at repeated
        intervals. Glyricidia plants should be planted at close spacing on all major bunds
        and all around the farm. They will act not only as biological fence but also provide
        biologically fixed nitrogen to soil.
        A 400 mt long Glyricidia strip can provide 22.5 kg N/ha per year from the year 3
        and up to 77 Kg N/ha from year 7 under rainfed conditions. This can be 75-100%
        higher under irrigated conditions. Three to four harvests can be made under
        irrigated conditions and two harvests under unirrigated conditions. Never allow
        them to grow above 5.5 ft to avoid shading effect. Lopping is used as green leaf
        manure. Simply harvest them and incorporate in soil before sowing or use as
        mulch.</p>
    <h3>Conversion of soil to organic <br>
        Banning of chemicals</h3>
    <p>It is widely known fact that some biological processes of
        plants involved in acquiring nutrients such as nitrogen e.g. N2 fixation are
        generally inhibited by adding Nitrogen fertilizer. Soil scientists generally caution
        against non-judicious fertilizer use and encourage use of organic compost
        otherwise it may lead to deficiency of micronutrients. Therefore in organic
        farming systems there is no place for chemicals.</p>
    <h3>Low input alternative</h3>
    <p>- In first year simultaneously sow three different types of
        legumes in strips, first of 60 days (like moong), second of 90-120 days (Cow pea
        or soybean) and third of more than 120 days (red gram) in strips. Apply mixture
        of Compost and vermicompost (2:1) @ 2.5 ton per acre enriched with 4 kg
        Azotobacter and 4 kg PSB biofertilizers or 4 kg consortia of customized cultures
        as basal dose at the time of sowing preferably in furrows below the seeds. Seeds
        of legumes should be treated with crop specific strains of Rhizobium biofertilizer.
        Mulch the entire surface with a thick layer of biological mulch and drench the
        biomass with Jivamrut @ 200 lit per acre. Seedlings will emerge from this layer. If
        soil is poor in phosphorus then apply 300 kg of low grade mineral rock-phosphate
        along with the compost. Apply second dose of Jivamrut after 25-30 days of
        sowing with irrigation water or during rains.
        To add to diversity 100 plants/ acre of marigold or Hibiscus subdarifa may be
        planted randomly through out the field. Few seedlings of vegetables such as
        chillies, tomato, brinjal, etc and rhizomes of turmeric, ginger etc can be planted
        randomly for home consumption.
        Harvest the pods/ fruits and use remaining biomass for mulch. Collect the crop
        biomass at the end of strips in the form of heaps and drench with Jivamrut. Sow
        short duration leafy vegetables (such as fenugreek or spinach) in the space
        vacated by the first and second crop and mulch the surface with treated biomass.
        Harvest leafy vegetable and grains and incorporate remaining biomass in the soil
        at appropriate time.
        In next season apply compost-vermicompost mixture @ 2.5 ton/ha and sow
        cereal crop with legume as inter or companion crop. After harvest use entire
        legume and remaining part of cereal crop as mulch. If irrigation facilities are
        there, take summer legume with some vegetable crop. Recycle entire residue as
        mulch. Use 3-4 application of liquid manure (such as Jivamruta) during each
        cropping season for soil application. Now the soil is ready for high value
        horticultural crops.
    </p>
    <h3>High input alternative</h3>
    <p>Incorporate 2.5-3.0 ton compost/ vermicompost or 1.5
        ton of biodynamic compost, 500 kg crushed oil cakes, 500 kg rock phosphate,
        100 kg neem cake, 5 kg Azotobacter and 5kg PSB biofertilizer or 4 kg consortia
        of customized cultures in soil through broadcasting or by drilling in furrows below
        the seeds. Sow 3-4 types of different crops in strips. 40% crop stand should be of
        legumes. Randomly plant 100-150 marigold and vegetable seedlings for
        increased diversity. After harvest incorporate entire residue in soil or use as
        mulch after sowing of the next crop. For second crop also use similar quantities
        of manures. Use liquid manure (Jivamruta) @ 200lit/acre 3-4 times during
        cropping season along with irrigation water. For increased productivity 2-3 sprays
        of vermiwash or vermiwash+cow urine or Panchgavya can also be provided.</p>
    <p>In fruit orchards cultivate 3-4 types of legume mixtures as mixed or intercrop in
        inter spaces along with adequate quantity of manures (as specified above). After
        pod/ grain harvest mulch the entire soil surface with the left over biomass and
        drench the biomass with 2 applications of Jivamruta. </p>
    <p>After about 12-18 months the soil will be ready for organic cultivation of any crop
        combination. For next two-three years, along with any crop incorporate legumes
        as inter or companion crops. Ensure that crop residue always have at least 30%
        residue from legumes. Also treat crop residue with liquid manure before
        incorporating into soil or using as mulch. </p>
    <h3>Multiple croping and crop rotation</h3>
    <p>Mix cropping is the outstanding feature of organic farming in which variety of
        crops are grown simultaneously or at different time on the same land. In every
        season care should be taken to maintain legume cropping at least 40%. Mix
        cropping promotes photosynthesis and avoids the competition for nutrients
        because different plants draw their nutrients from different depth of soil. The
        legume fixes atmospheric nitrogen and make available for companion or
        succeeding crops. Deep rooted plants drew nutrient from deeper layer of soil and
        bring them to the surface of soil through their leaf fall. So the nutrients leached
        down to lower strata are further brought back to upper layer by these deep rooted
        plants. Also help in protecting soil from soil erosion. Farmers should select the
        crops combination according to their needs and season. </p>
    <p>In selecting crop combinations, only compatible crops should be planted, for e.g.
        maize gets along well with beans and cucumber, tomatoes go well with onions
        and marigold. On the other hand beans and onions do not go well with each
        other. </p>
    <p>Entire farm should have at least 8-10 types of crops at all the times. Each field/
        plot should have at least 2-4 types of crops out of which one should be legum.In case if only one crop is taken
        in one plot then adjacent plots should have
        different crops. For maintenance of diversity and pest control randomly plant 50-
        150/acre vegetable seedlings for home consumption and 100 plants/acre of
        marigold (Genda) in all crop fields. Even high nutrient demanding crops such as
        sugarcane can also be grown with suitable combination of various legume and
        vegetable crops with optimum productivity.</p>
    <h3>Crop Rotation </h3>
    <p>Crop rotation is the back bone of organic farming practices. To keep the soil
        healthy and to allow the natural microbial systems working, crop rotation is must.
        Crop rotation is the succession of different crops cultivated on same land. Follow
        3-4 years rotation plan. All high nutrient demanding crops should precede and
        follow legume dominated crop combination. Rotation of pest host and non pest
        host crops helps in controlling soil borne diseases and pest. It also helps in
        controlling weeds. It is better for improving productivity and fertility of soil. Crop
        rotations help in improving soil structure through different types of root system.
        Legumes should be used frequently in rotation with cereal and vegetable crops.
        Green manure crops should also find place in planning rotations. High nutrient
        demanding crops should always be followed by legume crops and returned back
        to soil. Some important benefits of crop rotations are: <br> a. Not all Plants Have same nutritive needs. <br>
        b. Soil structure is improved through different types of roots <br>c. Pest build up is avoided and <br>d.
        Rotations help against the build up of weeds. </p>
    <h3>Status of rich and live organic soil </h3>
    <p>A fertile and live organic soil ideally should have Organic Carbon (C) between
        0.8-1.5%. At any point of time it should have adequate quantity of dry, semi
        decomposed and fully decomposed organic matter for the use of micro-flora and
        fauna. Total microbial load (bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes) should be above
        1 x 108
        /gm of soil. There should be at least 3-5 earth worms/cubic ft of soil.
        There should be enough quantity of small life forms and insects such as ants etc.</p>
