            <h1> Tomatoes </h1>
            Tomato is a warm season crop, it requires a warm and cool climate. The plants cannot withstand frost and high humidity. Also, light intensity affects pigmentation,fruit color,fruit set. Tne plant is highly affected by adverse climatic conditions. It requires different climatic range for seed germination,seedling growth,flowerand fruit set and fruit quality.
            <p>The major tomato producing states in India are Bihar, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. In Punjab state, Amritsar, Ropar, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur are tomato growing districts.</p>

            <h2>Time of planting for Tomato Cultivation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Tomato is a day-nutral plant so wildly it found grown in any season</li>
                <li>In the northen plains 3 crops are taken but in forest affected area rabi crop is not fruitful. The kharif crop is transplanted in july,rabi crop in February months. </li>
                <li>In the southern plains where there is no danger of frost, the first transplanting is done in December-January, Second June-July and Third in September-October depending on the irrigation facilities available.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box3">
                <h2>Average Water requirement</h2>
                Tomato plants need to be watered daily or every other day unless you have had recent rain. The plants need 1-1.5 inches of water per week, but container-grown tomato plants need to be watered twice per day. The best time to water your plants is early in the morning before the sun gets too hot.
        </div>
        <div class="box4">
            <h2>Irrigation Scheduling</h2>
            The crop performance is sensitive to the irrigation practices. In general a prolonged severe water deficit limits growth and reduces yields which cannot be corrected by heavy watering later on. Highest demand for water is during flowering. however, withholding irrigation during this period is sometimes recommended to force less mature plants into flowering in order to obtain uniform flowering and ripening. Care should be exercised in this to avoid damage to the mature plants.
            <p>Excessive watering during the flowering period (2) has been shown to increase flower drop and reduce fruit set. Also this may cause excessive vegetative growth and a delay in ripening. Water supply during and after fruit set must be limited to a rate which will prevent stimulation of new growth at the expense of fruit development. Heavy, irregular irrigations or dry periods alternating with wet periods should be avoided. For production of salad tomato with more than one harvest, the crop flourishes best under light, frequent irrigation, well-distributed over the growing period with the soil depletion level during the different growth periods remaining below 40 percent (p < 0.4).This promotes optimum growth during the total growing period and results in high yield of good quality. With one harvest uniform ripening is required and the depletion level during this period may increase to 60 to 70 percent.</p>
            <p>When water supply is limited, application for a salad crop can be concentrated during periods of transplanting, flowering (2) and yield formation (3). For a crop grown for paste production, a more extensive irrigation may be applied with last heavy irrigation applied prior to flowering.</p>

            <h2>Irrigation Methods</h2>
            Surface irrigation by furrow is commonly practised. Under sprinkler irrigation the occurrence of fungal diseases and possibly bacterial canker may become a major problem. Further, under sprinkler, fruit set may be reduced with an increase in fruit rotting. In the case of poor quality water, leaf burn will occur with sprinkler irriga-tion; this may be reduced by sprinkling at night and shifting of sprinkler lines with the direction of the prevailing wind. Due to the crops specific demands for a high soil water content achieved without leaf wetting, trickle or drip irrigation has been successfully applied.
