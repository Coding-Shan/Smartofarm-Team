    <h1>Organic Farming marketing strategies</h1>
    <h2>Direct Marketing Channels & Strategy for Organic Products</h2>
    <p>Farmers approach direct marketing in a variety of ways using single or multiple channels. The goal generally is to develop a strategy to sell all the product they produce. This can be through one marketing channel or several. Farms may also add additional direct market channels as the business grows. For instance, many farmers begin with selling through a farmers’ market or a roadside stand. As the business grows they can add other direct channels such as a CSA, grocery or restaurant sales. Direct sales channels for specific crops or a segment of a crop may be combined with wholesale channels. The options are nearly endless.</p>

        <h2>Community Supported Agriculture—CSA</h2>
        <p>Community supported agriculture is a relatively recent and innovative concept that is intended to create a relationship between farmers and consumers wherein risks and bounties are shared. CSA customers buy shares for a season by paying a fee in advance. In return, they receive a regular (in most cases weekly) selection of food. Having cash in advance of the growing season and a regular customer following provide financial security for farmers. The regular supply of food grown on the farm provide nutritional security and a sense of community for customers. On some farms, get-togethers with customers or workdays are part of the agreement. In its purest form, customers share in the risk of low production and crop failures, as well as any abundance, by receiving less or more food. This aspect has seen a variety of adaptations on CSA farms. <br>

            Generally, families pay about $400 to $600 per share. Operating a CSA requires excellent crop management skills to provide attractive and diverse weekly food baskets, as well as good customer service. CSA can be integrated with farmers’ market sales and other techniques. It has been an excellent start-up strategy for many small organic farms, providing crucial cash flow at the beginning of the growing season and allowing farmers to “boot strap” their way into farming.</p>

        <h2> Build a Strong Online Presence</h2>
        <p>As an organic farm brand, you will be able to reach out to a large consumer base online. If you have a strong presence on the internet, then you will have an advantage over your competitors. With attractive imagery, graphic design, and easy navigation, you can highlight your brand online and instantly appeal to your customers as well. Think of it this way. There are so many businesses that are trying to make people buy their products through their web pages and social media</p>

        <h2> Collaborate With a Grocery Store or Chain</h2>
        <p>Now, this might seem like a big step but can be highly useful for promoting your organic farm brand. There may be a few small grocery stores or chains around and convincing one or two to stock your produce or product could be a good idea. It will give you a much-needed boost, both in terms of marketing and making your brand accessible. Most people do like to try new things which is what will work in your favor. If you are able to catch the eye of the customer with your unique logo design or features on the product, then it’s a huge step forward.</p>

        <h2> Get Support from an Influencer</h2>
        <p>Once you have created a solid presence online, influencer marketing or promotion will help you become well-known and recognized. Basically, those personalities with a huge following on social media networks can highlight certain brands to their audience and lead to an increase in sales. You may not be on board with getting influencers to promote your brand but it really is something that you should look into. Find someone whose presence and values can represent your products in the best way possible.
<br>
            Then, team up with them through a giveaway or contest so that people become interested in what you have to offer. This way, you will be able to capture the attention of the customers and convince them to shift to your brand as well.</p>

        <h2> Partner Up With a Local Restaurant</h2>
        <p>Basically, a local restaurant could feature your organic products and then promote this partnership. This could help people realize the benefits they can get with your brand and become familiar with something new. With the promotion from a restaurant, the business will be able to establish itself as reliable and healthy too. Some places also stack various items for purchase so you can also try availing that option. If your product or produce is visible on a shelf in a restaurant, there is a higher chance of customers picking it up.</p>
