                        <li>The fungi also attacks the petioles, stolons, fruit stalks and fruit as shallow black spots

                            disease is detected early, its development may be slowed using fungicides. Keep in mind
                            however, that common leaf spot is often merely a cosmetic issue and the use of fungicides

                            <li>All you need is a bit of vinegar, water, and a colander or salad spinner. To start off,
                                pour about ½ cup of white vinegar and 2 ½ cups of water into a large bowl, and soak your
                                berries in the mixture for a few minutes. The vinegar will get rid of mold spores and
                                bacteria, which make your strawberries spoil quicker.</li>
