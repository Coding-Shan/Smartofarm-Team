        <h1> Grapes </h1>
        <p>The grape plant is a perennial bush featuring helices tendrils and trails. Grape is a vine a climbing plant. The tendrils, which are degenerated inflorescences, grow on stems.Leaves are shaped like a heart. They are big and placed opposite to each other. They show prominent nerves. Color, size, and shape of leaves and fruits vary with the variety.There are seedless and seeded varieties. The seeded variety may show upto 4 seeds per fruit. Seeds have 4-6% tannins.

        <h2> Average Water requirements</h2>
        <p>Although specific watering needs depend on the grape variety, soil type, and time of year, a good rule of thumb for grapes is to water the soil they're planted in down to a depth of 12 inches once per week.</p>
        <p> The actual water requirements reached 601 and 736 mm water depth respectively with application efficiency reaching 82.6% and 69.8% respectively. The irrigation water productivity of the bubbler irrigation was significant (3.8 kg/m 3) while it was less under basin irrigation (1.8 kg/m 3).<p>

        <h2>Best planting time:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Between february and march for North India</li>
            <li>Between November and January for Peninsular India</li>
            <li>Between December and January for TamilNadu and Karnataka</li>
        <p>Grape cultivation is generally not done during monsoon.</p>
        <p>Grape plant begins to grow 10-15 days after planting. Grape growth starts earlier in warm season than in cold season.</p>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box3">
            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p> Grapes in India are mostly grown in semi-arid dry areas with inadequate rainfall and high evapotranspiration losses. Therefore supplementary irrigation becomes a necessity. Water requirement of vines is different during different stages of growth. </p>
            <p> Vines are irrigated immediately after pruning and fertilizer application. During the berry growth stage, irrigated is given at intervals of 5-7 days. Water is withheld for atleast 8-10 days prior to harvesting to improve the fruit quality. Irrigation is resumed afterpruning. During the period from summer pruning to the onset of rains irrigation is given at weekly intervals and thereafter at 10-12 days intervals until winter purning depending upon the soil moisture condition. Excessive irrigation should be avoided during 45-50 days after summer purning as it adversely affects the flower initiation by promoting vegetative growth. similarly too frequent and heavy irrigation from flower opening to pea size stage of the barries should also be avoided as they aggravate the problem of downy mildew disease.</p>
            <p> The most common irrigation methods followed by the growers to irrigate their grapevines are furrow or ring method.However in recent years,where the available water for irrigation is very less and the soils are medium to heavy clay soils drip irrigation is being practiced.This system envisages the economic and efficient use of irrigation water. Quantity of water to be given per day, rate of discharge ,placement of emitters and their clogging are important considerations in drip irrigation of grapes.</p>
