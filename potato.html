                    <ul>
                        <li>In addition to the potato, the pathogen also damages plants such as chili, tomato, tobacco
                            and egg plant, as well as several species of weeds</li>
                        <li>The symptoms of bacterial wilt infection can be seen on all parts of infected plants</li>
                        <li>Infected plant begins to wilt, starting from the tips of the leaves or where the stems
                            branch out, and then spreading to all parts of the plant</li>
                        <li>Leaves become yellow at their bases, then the whole plant wilts and dies. When stems are cut
                            a brown colored ring will be visible</li>
                        <li>When a tuber is cut in half, black or brown rings will, however, be visible. If left for a
                            while or squeezed, these rings will exude a thick white fluid</li>
                        <li>A further symptom is fluid coming out of tuber eyes. This can be signified by soil sticking
                            to tuber eyes when crops are harvested. Serious infection causes tubers to rot</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="disease-symtoms">
                    <h3>Survival and spread</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TBacterial wilt pathogen can survive in soil (without a host for several seasons), water,
                            seed tubers, potato plant remnants</li>
                        <li>The disease can spread from field to field or from plant to plant within field via infected
                            seed, air, water, soil, farming tools, livestock and people</li>

                            also be a source of the disease in the field

                    <ul>
                        <li>Bacterial wilt can survive in potato seed tubers. Infected tubers should be disinfected by
                            heat treatment. Bacterial wilt can be controlled by exposing the seed tubers to hot air (112
                            ºF) with 75% relative humidity for 30 min </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>This disease damages leaves, stems and tubers. Affected leaves appear blistered as if
                            scalded by hot water and eventually rot and dry out
                        </li>
                        <li>When drying out, leaves turn brown or black in color. When infections are still active,
                            spots appear on the underside of leaves blanketed in what looks like flour</li>
                        <li>Affected stems begin to blacken from their tips, and eventually dry out</li>
                        <li>Severe infections cause all foliage to rot, dry out and fall to the ground, stems to dry out
                            and plants to die</li>
                        <li>Affected tubers display dry brown-colored spots on their skins and flesh. This disease acts
                            very quickly. If it is not controlled, infected plants will die within two or three days
                        </li>
